# Persian_POS_Tagger

It's a Persian POS Tagger trained by [The Persian Universal Dependency Treebank (Persian UD)](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Persian) with Tensorflow.
I've used [TensorFlow Part-of-Speech Tagger](https://github.com/mrahtz/tensorflow-pos-tagger) codes for this purpose.

##Using
